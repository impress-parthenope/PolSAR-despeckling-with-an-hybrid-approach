In this paper study on the effect of different training approaches for PolSAR despeckling is provided.
Inspired by similar analysis on SAR amplitude case in [Hybrid-MONet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9474572) and [G-MOnet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10250969)
a multi-temporal and training approach for training a CNN for PolAR despeckling is provided. The dataset has been tested on [MONet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9261137) customized for the PolSAR case.
